Generally this agreement does not set forth either (1) the characteristics of the stock being sold (which are defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) or (2) the relationship among the parties after the closing, such as registration rights, rights of first refusal and co-sale and voting arrangements (these matters often implicate persons other than just the Company and the investors in this round of financing and are usually embodied in separate agreements to which those others persons are parties, or in some cases in the Certificate of Incorporation). The main items of negotiation in the Stock Purchase Agreement are therefore the price and number of shares being sold, the representations and warranties that the Company must make to the investors and the closing conditions for the transaction.\nSERIES A PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT\nTHIS SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this \u201cAgreement\u201d), is made as of [], 20[], by and among [______], a Delaware corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d), and the investors listed on Exhibit A attached to this Agreement (each a \u201cPurchaser\u201d and together the \u201cPurchasers\u201d).\nThe parties hereby agree as follows:",
