        Parse the responses from the model.

        The default behavior is to return the responses as they are.
        Overwrite this method if you want to parse the responses in a different way. You can use the CustomParser
        classes in the examples folder as reference.

        Remember that the responses returned from this method will be stored in a file and used for the evaluation,
        so please follow the following format, when returning the responses:
        [
            [response1_prompt1, response2_prompt1, ...],
            [response1_prompt2, response2_prompt2, ...],
